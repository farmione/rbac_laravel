 ## RBAC ( ***Role Based Access Control*** )
 
* This repo demonstrates ```role based access control``` feature without using any third party packages.
* It uses a ```middleware``` to check the user's role and permissions and a ```blade template``` to conditionally display menu items based on the user's role.
